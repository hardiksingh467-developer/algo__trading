### What is HFT
```
High Frequency Trading put very simply is finding opportunities in the market and capitalizing on them, and doing in the manner where it relies on the speed of execution,
HFT traders do not care about the asset they are trading is, it can be dog shit for all they care, the only thing they care about is the price they see on the screen, because that price is subject to change and all change leads to different opportunity

A practical application of HFT is, arbitrage ( a simple strategy ).
Price is simply a number on the screen and different people across the globe have different number on the screen for the same commodity, hence buying a commodity for less price at location/exchange A and selling that commodity for a higher price at location/exchange B.

Now HFT is called High Frequency for a reason, because the above mentioned opportunity arise and die as quickly as they are risen, 

There are thousand of different firms and they do not use the same strategy, they may all employ the same basic type of strategies but different firms may employ a different Proprietary strategy that other firms don't even know about.

Like another opportunity an HFT firms may look into might be for a subjective commodity, so they may create a given amount of models for a given commodity, that might price a commodity for a given price, their model puts out a subjective valuation for bananas at a dollar fifty, they don't care what it is currently worth in the market, if it's worth less than there projected price they may buy it and if it is worth less then they may short it
