### Python vs C++ in Quant
```
There is not one best language for all the Quants, There is a best language for each Quant, it depends on the project you are working on


1. `Popularity`: Python > C++, Python is much more popular as compared to C++, the more it is popular, the more you can find code ready to use in your own project

2. `Simplicity`: Python > C++, Python is much more simple as compared to C++, this simplicity makes Python much slower as compared to C++

3. `Speed`: C++ > Python, C++ is much more fast as compared to Python

4. `ML and AI`: Python > C++, Python is much more used as compared to C++ when it comes to Machine Learning because of all ready to use libraries that you can integrate into your own project

This concludes to Python being extremely useful for Rapid ProtoTyping and researching whereas C++ is more useful when it comes to build solid foundation of applications that are never to be changed

If you are working on Day Trading Strategies, or Data Analysis, or Data Science Project, this calls for use of Python, especially when we are not using a lot of data, that is a database with less than 1 million data

If you are building a Project for High Frequency Trading or with Huge Databases, especially if we are doing live trading, as the time frame in Scalping or High Frequency Trading 

One can also explore Julia, as it is as simple as Python and nearly as quick as C++
