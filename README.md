# Algo__Trading
#### The first thing to learn about Algo Trading is that this is your Dream, This path will set you away from everybody else, Ahead of everybody else, Better than everybody else, This is where they cannot even begin to think, this is where your hunt starts, No one here, just you and the system

For achieving the Mastery over above Checkpoints, we will be using Python and QuantConnect Algorithmic Trading Platform
Quant Connect has their own Browser IDE, which allows us to write our Algorithm right there, which allows us to test and deploy our code without additional Software download

We will go from very basic Algorithms to Advance Machine Learning Algorithms

The goal is to create at-least every algorithm for every asset class(Stocks, Bonds, Forex, CFD's, Crypto, Options, Futures)
In the beginning we will focus on equity, since this is the best way to get started

The concept learned from Stock Trading Bot are just as important for other asset class

When we are Developing and Testing our algorithm, we need to get the right data, and one solution for this is to scrape data from multiple websites, but this can be very time consuming and unreliable, on top of that we will not be able to find the data we need which is otherwise accessible for free

Luckily QuantConnect provides us with data from bunch of data vendors for free, they hava a huge collection of data and have also announced there plans to add data of other international markets as well

It is also possible to import your own custom data which will be covered

Another important concept is to keep the intellectual property safe for our algorithms
If we do not trust QuantConnect, we can also setup there Open-Source Trading Engine locally

We can also use Machine Learning for advanced algorithms, such as
tensorflow for Machine Learning
nltk for Sentiment Analysis

As QuantConnect supports hundreds of these, we won't need to install these locally although we can
