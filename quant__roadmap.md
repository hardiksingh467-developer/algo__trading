### Breaking into Quant
The three main roles where we can break into Quant are
1. Developer, People responsible for generating rapid implementation of trading strategies as well as deployment
2. Trader, People who are actually doing the trading
3. Researcher, People who are building models to either or mitigate a risk, or to generate Alpha

### Initial Remarks EVERYONE should consider
Nothing you can do can beat Networking. You can be the smartest person, you can have the most in-demand project, you can be basically a genius, it doesn't matter
If you do not network at all, you are just a blank slate applying from nowhere and you might get hired, you might not but it's uch more of a numbers game
Leverage any opportunity you can, whether from Linkedin or University or meets or dinners with speakers, it's totally priceless
If you are a university student, seek internships as fast as you can, up your resume and apply for internships every single summer
Networking at any Cost

Stop Over-complicating your education
Do not do Physics PhD
Do not do Data Science in Masters
Do not do BioTech
Do things directly relevant to your role


### Quantitative Developer
You need to have Good knowledge in Mathematics and Finance and be great in Coding
You need to be High Performance Computing Ready, take a low level Language like C++, just Python is not going to cut it

For a project, go to Quant Finance Archive and look up ARXIV, and look for an actual strategy that's on there in the Computation Finance section which is compute intensive, take that project and run your own implementation where you optimize the heck out of it
This would really demonstrate that you can take complex finance ideas and you can implement it in a way which has High fidelity 

### Quantitative Trader
This ones a Non Tech Role, this position mostly specializes in Mathematics and Finance

### Quantitative Researcher
In Research roles, Your Mathematics and Finance should be Off the charts, the more Math you know the more useful you are, If you know Math specific domains, like Physics, Chemistry or even Biology, you can work these knowledge base into Quantitative Finance Models
Coding is necessary as you need to Prototype your models, Machine Learning has become basic for firms now a these days
Mathematics is a very Theoretical stream, Finance is where the application lies

Be involved in undergrad research, or alternate research. Publish as much as you can to Targetted programs, reach out to potential PhD advisors as much as a Full year in Advance 

## One Clear Project to set yourself apart from others
